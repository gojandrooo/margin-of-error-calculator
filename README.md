# Margin of Error & Confidence Level
Used for quickly calculating margin-of-error (MOE) corresponding to confidence level for reporting survey results when the population size is known (future iteration to include population size unknown).
#### Notes:
+ results are for two-tailed test
+ assumes population follows normal distribution
+ assumes Proportion Percentage (p) = 0.5
+ MOE is rounded down to whole number
